Code Ocean Frontend Developer Challenge

## General
run `npm start` to start the app on port `3000`


## Task
Implement a lazy users list with a details view.    
You can use external libraries such as [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) for lazy loading

## API
users are available on `localhost:3001/users`   
this demo uses a basic [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#paginate)

## Requirements
1. Smooth scrolling
2. Scalable (support extremely high amount of users)

Good Luck!
